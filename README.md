### Customer, Product, and Sales Trends: Key Insights from 2010–2014

## 📈 Insights
- 2013 hit a peak of **$16.3M in sales**, a huge leap from prior years, with **17K+ customers** and **52K+ items sold**.  
- **December** was the top month, followed by **June** and **October**.

- Sales climbed steadily from **$43K in 2010** to **$29.35M by 2014**, reflecting consistent long-term expansion.  
- **Bikes dominate** with **96.46%** of total sales, far ahead of **Accessories (2.39%)** and **Clothing (1.16%)**. High-end bikes like **Mountain-200 Black-38** and **Road-250 Red-58** outperformed multi-year averages.  
- **2014 saw a sharp decline**, signaling potential demand saturation or product phase-out.

- **New customers dominate** — ~81% (14,826) of the base.  
- **Regular customers (2,039)** maintain long-term presence but lower spending.  
- **VIP customers (1,617)** are loyal high spenders, driving the largest revenue share.  
- Overall, the data reveals a **wide but shallow customer base**, underscoring the need for **stronger retention strategies**.
